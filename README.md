# CodSoft Data Science Internship


## About This Repository

This repository showcases the projects completed during my **Codsoft Data Science Internship**. The projects demonstrate my proficiency in various machine learning techniques and problem-solving skills, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Below are the three key projects:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   - **Model**: Logistic Regression  
   - **Description**: This project involved building a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Using features like age, class, and gender, the logistic regression model predicts the likelihood of survival, showcasing the application of classification algorithms.

2. **Movie Rating Prediction**  
   - **Model**: Linear Regression  
   - **Description**: In this project, I used linear regression to predict movie ratings based on various features, such as genre, director, and cast. The model aims to establish relationships between these features and the movie's rating, demonstrating regression analysis in action.

3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   - **Model**: Random Forest  
   - **Description**: The goal of this project was to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a random forest classifier. By analyzing features such as transaction time, amount, and other relevant factors, the model classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, highlighting the importance of handling imbalanced datasets and feature engineering.

These projects reflect my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data, evaluate model performance, and deliver actionable insights. Each project includes detailed documentation and code, providing a clear understanding of the methods and results.
